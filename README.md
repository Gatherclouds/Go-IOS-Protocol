# IOSBlockchain - A Secure & Scalable Blockchain for Smart Services

The Internet of Services (IOS) offers a secure & scalable infrastructure for online service providers. Its high TPS, scalable and secure blockchain, and privacy protection scales social and economic cooperation to a new level. For more information about IOS Blockchain, please refer to our [whitepaper](https://github.com/iost-official/Documents)

The source codes released in this repo represent part of our early alpha-quality codes, with the purpose to demonstrate our development progress. Currently, there are still parts of our project have been intensively working on in private repos. We will gradually release our code.

## Overview

This is the first release version (v0.1.0) of IOST, including the prototype of protocol, blockchain, database and testing libs.

## Components and features

Considering the seriously waste of power in POW and complex, unrobust implement of POS system, we using an auto devoting POB system to ensure consensus of IOST blockchain.

The rotating delegates are promoted by the contribution of IOST, such as recording and spreading transactions, running smart contract, and verifying transactions, which we called as Believability. Users send their transactions to recorders they trusted, recorders deal with transactions and signed their name into transactions, finally the best of recorder promoted to have a term of replica, to make new block and get reward.

For users, a good recorder can give response fastly and exactly, and user is willing to upload their transactions to such a good recorder, so the way of POB using to devote a delegate is much more natural than traditional POS. Further, cause one recorder couldn’t be the best choose of all users, the POB system has it’s power to resist centralize.

## Development Progress

v0.1.0 - MVP completed and preliminary tests conducted

v0.2.0 - Under development.

Our developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

Although we have started to go open source on Github starting April 9th, 2018 and released certain parts of our code/repositories, please note that we have only released a portion of them at this moment.  Since the project is still at its very early stage and some codes are related to our core technology, we have decided to go open source gradually until the launch of the main net.

## Test net

The IOS Blockchain is not yet to be used in production. We have deployed a private test net for early stage testing as planned. We will open the test network to public after the official release of Janus (v0.5) by the end of Q2 2018. This document will be updated then with instructions for running on the public test net.

## Contribution

Contribution of any forms is appreciated!

Currently, our core tech team is working intensively to develop the first stable version and core block chain structure. We will accept pull request after the first stable release published.
